### Modern APIs

1. IntersectionObserver - a browser api to check an item if in viewport.
2. <link rel="prefetch"> Prefetch the next resource(s) when the browser is idle. Not for 2g.
3. Responsive, lazily load images

- Load images once those enter the viewport
- Prefetch the pages in the background

Website Speedtest Tools:

- Chrome Audits/Lighthouse
- WebPageTest real world

> Performance isn't optional, it's baked in.

<!-- ## Product in Gatsby -->

Why Gatsby excited us

- Static publishing for modern web apps
- Integrations with 3rd party CMS
- Performance baked-in(images, code-splitting, etc.)
