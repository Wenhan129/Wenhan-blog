This is my first post on this personal blog. From today, I'm going to use this blog to record my daily thoughts about tech developments(mostly about Front End) and funny things.  
There are couple of things that motivate me to build this blog like practicing writing, thoughts sharing...  
But I think the most important thing is **I can use this blog to help me build a good process of learning and consuming the knowledge.**  
From the past three months of my first job as a junior front end developer, I did learn a lot of things. I enjoyed the process a lot from learning new things day by day. However, when I'm looking back from this point, I felt that there is something I've forgot to do - **to keep my thoughts organized**.  
So today I built this blog from Kyle's awesome work [Gatsby-Starter-Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).
I'm not very familiar with gatsby so far, but why not, let's try it first! In the next following days, I'm going to use this place to log a #100DaysOfCode, where I will spend at least one hour a day to code something new, fun or dumb, whatever Ha. Ok, here we go!
